# spdxl

spdxl (pronounced spud-exel) is a tool that attempts to determine the
license of a given source code directory or file. Inspired by
[ninka](https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka), this tool works in roughly
the same way, by checking source code looking for text and identifiers
that are typically used with FOSS licenses and copyright.
