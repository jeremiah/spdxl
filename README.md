# spdxl 

This is alpha quality software.

spdxl (pronounced spud-exel) is a tool that checks source 
code looking for SPDX version 2.0 "tags" and produces a text-based output
on the command line. Designed to be used in conjunction with Debian's licensecheck
it provides a way to ensure that all the files are correctly licensed and that 
you can created a complete SPDX document. 

## Bugs
