# spdxl

spdxl (pronounced spud-exel) is a tool that attempts to determine the
license of a given source code directory or file. This tool checks source 
code looking for SPDX version 2.0 "tags" and produces a text-based output
on the command line.

You can get tools that convert tags to spreadsheets here:
