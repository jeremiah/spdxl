# spdxl

spdxl (pronounced spud-exel) is a tool that attempts to determine the
license of a given source code directory or file. Inspired by [ninka](https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka),
this tool works in roughly the same way, by checking the source code
itself looking for text and identifiers that are used with FOSS
licenses and copyright.
