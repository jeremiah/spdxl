# spdxl

spdxl (pronounced spud-exel) is a tool to attempt to determine the
license of a given source code directory or file. Inspired by 'ninka',
this tool works in roughly the same way, by checking the source code
itself looking for text and identifiers that are used with FOSS
licenses and copyright.
